Project Title: SecureAuth - A PHP-based Authentication System

Project Description: 

SecureAuth is a PHP-based authentication system that allows users to register and login securely. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use authentication solution for web applications. The system uses a MySQL database to store user information, which is encrypted for enhanced security.

Features:

1. User Registration: SecureAuth provides a user-friendly registration process that allows users to create an account with their email and password. The system ensures that the user's password is stored securely using encryption.

2. Login System: SecureAuth also provides a secure login system that authenticates user credentials against the database. If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access to the application.

3. Secure Database: The system stores user information in a MySQL database that is encrypted using hashing algorithms. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the user's information will remain secure.

4. Customizable: SecureAuth is customizable and can be integrated into any PHP-based web application. The system can be easily modified to fit the design and requirements of your application.

Technologies Used:

PHP: The authentication system is built using PHP, a popular server-side programming language for web development.

MySQL: The system uses a MySQL database to store user information securely.
Encryption Algorithms: SecureAuth uses encryption algorithms to encrypt and secure user passwords.

CSS: The system is styled using CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.

How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the SQL file in the project directory to your MySQL database.
3. Configure the database connection in the userRegistration.db_conn.php file.
4. Use the authentication system in your web application.

Conclusion:

SecureAuth is a secure and reliable authentication system that provides a user-friendly registration and login process. The system is built using PHP and MySQL and uses encryption algorithms to secure user information. With SecureAuth, you can ensure that your web application is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
